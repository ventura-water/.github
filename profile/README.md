# VENTURA – virtual decision rooms for water neutral planning 

## What is VENTURA?

VENTURA is a 24-month applied research project that started in September 2021 focusing on study areas in Greater Manchester and Enfield, London. The project is funded by the Engineering and Physical Research Council as part of their Digital Economies: Sustainable Digital Societies¹ programme. This Briefing Note covers work in Greater Manchester; a separate note has been produced for the Enfield study.

VENTURA is an interdisciplinary team of systems thinking and digital geoscience researchers from Imperial College London (ICL), University College London (UCL), and British Geological Survey (BGS). The Greater Manchester study is supported by Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA), United Utilities (UU) and the Environment Agency (EA), and focuses on the Upper Mersey Catchment. This group formed an integrated water management trilateral partnership prior to VENTURA in 2021². Their aim is to influence and deliver sustainable growth in Greater Manchester by improving flood risk resilience, enhancing the environment, driving circular economy approaches, and supporting regeneration.

## Why is VENTURA important?

VENTURA aims to produce a common interactive digital evidence base for future integrated water management planning. This will be based on an integrated water systems model coupled to an interactive user-friendly web interface, collectively called a Virtual Decision Room.

Water management is a systems-of-systems challenge encompassing water consumption, use, discharge, treatment and its return to water bodies – in each case, water, sewerage, and associated infrastructure affects societal adaptation and resilience to surface water flooding and water quality changes. The current policy space in the UK that is affecting future decisions is complex and involves a range of stakeholders and initiatives.

Decision making for water management is organisationally siloed with governance needing to accommodate many roles and responsibilities. This involves interacting within the same geographical area but working towards different investment incentives and metrics but ultimately accountable to government and the public. There are often tensions between different stakeholder requirements, especially around funding, regulations, policy, liability and organisational goals. At a VENTURA workshop Greater Manchester partners listed the influential stakeholders, including central Government, OfWat, water companies, local / regional planning authorities, Lead Local Flood Authorities, Environment Agency, NGOs, and the public.
